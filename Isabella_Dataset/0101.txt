isabella_ai, Photograph of a woman standing in a bright, modern studio. She is wearing a black, full-body, long-sleeve wetsuit with a zipper down the front and black, cat-ear motorcycle helmet that covers her face except for her eyes. She has long, brown hair that flows out from under the helmet. Her right hand is placed on her hip, and she has a confident expression. The studio has white walls and large windows, with sunlight streaming in. In the background, there is a dress form, a table with papers and a pencil, and a bulletin board with sketches and fabric swatches. The wetsuit has "TED BULL" written on it in light gray text. The woman is standing slightly to the right of the center of the image. The lighting is natural, and the overall style is modern and minimalist. The photograph is sharp and well-composed, highlighting the contrast between the dark wetsuit and the bright studio.
